Their voice is smooth, their body language is confident, and they don't even have to try too hard — they just have that vibe. This type uses beauty, grace, and allure to make people fall. It's like a walking fantasy.",
            Rake: "This one's the romantic daredevil. They say the right things, flirt deeply, and make you feel like you're the only one in the world — even if they flirt with 10 others later. They're all passion and fire. You'd fall for them fast... and maybe regret it later.",
            IdealLover: "They make you feel seen. They pay attention to little details, understand your dreams, and become the exact person you were wishing for. Being around them feels like a movie romance — calm, deep, and dreamy.",
            Dandy: "This person doesn't follow any rules — not masculine, not feminine — just themselves. They wear what they want, act how they feel, and their confidence makes them stand out. You never know what they'll do next, and that mystery is hot.",
            Natural: "They're like a fun, playful kid — laughing easily, innocent but a little naughty. They make people feel light, relaxed, and happy. You can't help but want to be around their positive energy.",
            Coquette: "They give you just enough attention to get you hooked... then pull back. Hot one moment, cold the next. They make you chase them, and just when you're about to give up — they smile, and boom, you're back in. Total mind game master.",
            Charmer: "Smooth talker. Always knows what to say. They make everyone feel good — the kind of person who compliments your hair, remembers your favorite song, and makes you smile without being too intense. They're friendly, warm, and persuasive.",
            Star: "They shine. Confidence, mystery, and a bit of magic. People are drawn to them, want to know more, want to be around them. It's not about beauty — it's about presence. Like a celebrity, even if they're not famous.",
            Charismatic: "Your vision inspires devotion. Others want to follow your lead and energy. You have a magnetic personality that draws people in.",
            Seductress: "This one is subtle but powerful. They listen more than they speak, look you right in the eyes, and slowly pull you in. They're not loud or flashy — they're emotionally smart, mysterious, and know exactly how to make you crave more."
